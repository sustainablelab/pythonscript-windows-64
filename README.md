# Context

All contents in this repo (except for this `README.md`) is just
the `windows-64` folder from:

https://github.com/touilleMan/godot-python-assetlib-repo/tree/master/addons/pythonscript

touilleMan's GitHub page for the project is here:

TODO(slab): Setup a similar repo copy of the `osx-64` folder for
macOS users.

## Getting this the normal way

Normally this is installed by opening Godot and searching for
`pythonscript` in the **AssetLib**. And that is how I obtained
this copy, version 0.50.0.

## For collaborators on Windows and macOS

So why do I need this copy -- what's wrong with installing
through Godot? My collaborators are Windows and macOS users and
they do not use Godot. I created this copy to make it easier for
them to run my Godot projects.

Ideally, I'd just give them a Windows or macOS executable.
Unfortunately, project export does not yet work on Windows and
macOS for projects that use the pythonscript addon. Collaborators
run my project by cloning my project, downloading Godot, then
making an alias to execute Godot on my project's project.godot
file. That much is reasonable. But asking people to also setup
pythonscript and do the pip install steps is a bit much.

So, instead of walking folks through downloading pythonscript via
the Godot AssetLib and doing the pip install steps, I came up
with this workaround:

- I make this repo a git submodule in my Godot project
- I tell my collaborators:
    - to `git clone` the project
    - and to run the two `git submodule` commands that copy this
      repo (and my other submodules) into their local repo

# Steps for making a new project

Create a Godot project. Copy the `pythonscript.gdnlib` into the
project top level. Here it is:

```
[general]

singleton=true
load_once=true
symbol_prefix="godot_"

[entry]

Windows.64="res://addons/pythonscript/windows-64/pythonscript.dll"

[dependencies]

Windows.64=[]
```

Also create an `addons` folder at the top level:

```bash
mkdir addons
```

Add this repo as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/sustainablelab/pythonscript-windows-64.git addons/pythonscript
```

*Notice the above command also puts the repo in the correct
folder.*

The directory structure should now be:

```
project-folder/
    pythonscript.gdnlib
    addons/
        SUBMODULE GOES HERE IN A FOLDER NAMED: pythonscript/
            windows-64/
    (other top-level files and folders)
```

*This mimics the structure when installed through the Godot
AssetLib.*

I treat Python packages I am developing for use in the project in
the same way. I add the Python package as a submodule in the
addons folder. I also install it in **editable** mode (with
`-e`). For those unfamiliar, the python.exe *used by
pythonscript* comes with no packages except for the `godot`
package and you pip install whatever you need.

```
project-folder/
    addons/
        pythonscript/
            windows-64/
                python.exe <--- THIS PYTHON
```

I pip install my development packages in **editable** mode so
that collaborators get updates to my Python package simply by
pulling the submodule changes, rather than having to remember how
to reinstall my package via pip. It also saves me time: pushing
to a GitHub repo is much faster than re-uploading to PyPI.

# Steps for cloning an existing project

Clone the project like you would any other repo:

```bash
git clone ...
```

The submodules are empty folders. Pull the submodules in with
these two commands:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
